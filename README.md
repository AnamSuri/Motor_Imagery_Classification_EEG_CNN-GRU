# Motor_Imagery_Classification_EEG_CNN-GRU
This repository consists of experiments and code files for Motor Imagery Classification on "A large EEG dataset for studying cross-session variability in motor imagery brain-computer interface.
In this, we have proposed a novel hybrid model EEG_CNN-GRU consisting of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) to capture spatio-temporal patterns in the EEG data. The architecture of the proposed model is gievn below:

We have performed different cross-session and cross-subject experiments. The genral scenario of the experiments performed in the literature is described in the follwoing figure. For this study, we have incorporated scenarios 'c' and 'd' only.
